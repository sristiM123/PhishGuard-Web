PhishGuard Privacy Policy

PhishGuard does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data from users.
All security analysis—including link scanning, message checking, and risk scoring—happens entirely on the user’s device. No browsing data, text, emails, passwords, communications, or network requests are sent to any external server.

PhishGuard does not track users, does not use analytics, and does not share information with third parties.
All settings and dashboard statistics are stored locally in the browser and remain fully under the user's control.

If you have any questions, you may contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store.
